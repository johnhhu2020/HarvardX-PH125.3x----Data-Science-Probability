## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Section 1 Overview



Section 1 introduces you to Discrete Probability. Section 1 is divided into three parts:

        Introduction to Discrete Probability
        Combinations and Permutations
        Addition Rule and Monty Hall

After completing Section 1, you will be able to:

        apply basic probability theory to categorical data.
        perform a Monte Carlo simulation to approximate the results of repeating an experiment over and over, including simulating the outcomes in the Monty Hall problem.
        distinguish between: sampling with and without replacement, events that are and are not independent, and combinations and permutations.
        apply the multiplication and addition rules, as appropriate, to calculate the probably of multiple events occurring.
        use sapply() instead of a for loop to perform element-wise operations on a function.

There are 3 assignments that use the DataCamp platform for you to practice your coding skills. There are also some quick probability calculations for you to perform directly on the edX platform as well, and there is a longer set of problems at the end of section 1.

This section corresponds to the following section of the course textbook.

We encourage you to use R to interactively test out your answers and further your learning.
